<p>PowerScan is a collection of powershell scripts designed for finding system information as a non-admin or unprivledged user. This program's main function is to determine basic system information (usernames, registry information, etc.). This information is then logged to the /logs folder and can be retrieved and analyzed easily after runtime.</p>
